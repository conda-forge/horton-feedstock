  summary: "Helpful Open-source Research TOol for N-fermion systems"
  description: |
    HORTON is a Helpful Open-source Research TOol for N-fermion systems, written primarily in the Python programming language. 
    (HORTON is named after the helpful pachyderm, not the Canadian caffeine supply store.) The ultimate goal of HORTON is to 
    provide a platform for testing new ideas on the quantum many-body problem at a reasonable computational cost. Although HORTON 
    is primarily designed to be a quantum-chemistry program, it can perform computations involving model Hamiltonians, and could 
    be extended for computations in nuclear physics.
